web is the Go toolkit and guide for web services:

* messages (DEFUNCT)

	Package messages provided a declarative and composable
	structure for defining HTTP responses in Go.

	-------------------------------------------------------

	Present in v0.3.0; removed v0.4.0 on 2025-08-01

	While adopting a declarative approach in handlers 
	remains beneficial, this specific package was 
	ultimately unnecessary for the following reasons:

	- Implicit values: Struct-based response types 
	  inherently permit fields to hold zero values, 
	  defeating the purpose of transparency in handlers.

	- Unnecessary abstraction: The package required 
	  adapters converting to http.Handler or 
	  http.HandlerFunc to process the declarative Response 
	  type, introducing unnecessary complexity.

	- Logging redundancy: Errors encountered in handlers,
	  before a response is even needed, are typically logged 
	  there by the application's logging mechanism. 
	  Providing that logger on this package level is 
	  redundant and was architecturally misplaced.
	
	- Simplicity via application structs: Defining receiver 
	  methods on application-specific structs containing 
	  necessary dependencies (e.g., a logger), results in
	  a simpler, clearer design. This avoids the extra
	  abstraction layers, reduces cognitive load, and
	  makes the response construction clearer and more
	  maintainable.

	Example of a simplified approach:

	|	type application struct {
	|		log *slog.Logger
	|	}
	|
	|	func (app application) Respond(w http.ResponseWriter, status int, header http.Header, body []byte) {
	|		for k, vals := range header {
	|			for _, v := range vals { 	
	|				w.Header().Add(k, v)	
	|			}
	|		}
	|		
	|		w.WriteHeader(status)
	|		if body != nil {
	|			if _, err := w.Write(body); err != nil {
	|				// Status commited - too late to send HTTP error response; just log it.	
	|				app.log.Error("Respond write error: " + err.Error()	
	|			}
	|		}
	|	}

* middleware

	Package middleware provides composable HTTP middleware
	for use with net/http. It includes utilities for panic
	recovery and access logging.
