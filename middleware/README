Ideas Explored and Rejected (EARs):

* Rev	Provide Queue/Stack as middleware arrangement functions

	Present in v0.2.0; removed in v0.3.0 on 2025-07-25	

	While these convenience functions for chaining
	middleware seem helpful, they obscure execution order 
	and introduce ambiguity in naming. For example, does
	Queue imply middleware is applied in first-in-first-out
	order, or executed that way - which is arrangement in
	precisely the reverse order? Such abstractions 
	sacrifice clarity for superficially cleaner code.


* Prop	Include 'common' header-setting middleware
	
	Rejected on 2025-07-25

	Middleware that sets common headers - e.g., CORS or 
	OWASP secure headers - can simplify security 
	configuration. However, when additional headers are set
	within handlers, reasoning about the final response
	requires checking multiple places. This breaks locality
	of behavior and reduces clarity, expecially in light of
	the Response representation in package messsages.
